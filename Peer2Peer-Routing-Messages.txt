Peer 2 Peer protocole ideas
First concept

Here is a general strategy you might adopt:

Node Discovery and Network Maintenance:

Each node should be capable of discovering other nodes nearby through WiFi or radio communication.
Nodes should periodically share their routing tables to keep the network topology updated.
Routing Table:

Each node maintains a routing table that contains information about neighboring nodes and the shortest paths to reach other nodes.
ERC-20 addresses can be used as unique identifiers for each node.
Message Transmission:

Messages contain the ERC-20 destination address, the source, the message content, and perhaps a type of TTL (Time-to-Live) to prevent messages from circulating indefinitely in the network.
Each node checks the message's destination. If the node is the destination, it processes the message; otherwise, it forwards it to the best neighboring node based on its routing table.
The choice of the "best" neighboring node might be based on proximity, signal quality, number of hops, etc.
Mode of Transmission Selection:

Each node decides to transmit a message via WiFi or radio based on factors such as range, availability, congestion, etc.
If a node has internet access, it could use that to transmit messages to nodes that are far away or out of direct range, perhaps using a relay server or a messaging service.
Message Relay:

If a message needs to reach a node out of direct range, intermediary nodes act as relays to route the message to its destination.
This requires robust routing logic to avoid loops and ensure message delivery.
Reliability and Acknowledgment:

You'd probably want to implement some sort of acknowledgment to confirm the reception of messages.
This might include techniques to handle retransmissions in case of delivery failure.
Security:

The use of ERC-20 addresses is an interesting idea, especially if you incorporate some form of digital signature to authenticate and secure the messages.
Messages can be signed using the private key corresponding to the ERC-20 address, and other nodes can verify this signature with the address/pubkey.
Scaling and Congestion Management:

In a large network with many nodes, congestion can become an issue.
Techniques like flow control, rate limiting, and message prioritization might be necessary.
Interfacing with Other Networks:

If certain nodes have additional interconnection capabilities (e.g., satellite link, LTE), they could act as gateways to route traffic to and from other networks.
Tests and Simulations:

Before deploying, it would be beneficial to simulate the protocol in various scenarios to identify potential issues and optimize performance.
This is a high-level overview, and there are many details and technical considerations to account for during implementation. It would also be wise to consult existing P2P protocols for ideas and best practices.

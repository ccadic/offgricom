A radio mesh network (or wireless mesh network) is a network architecture where nodes are all dynamically interconnected and can cooperate with each other to route data packets. The main technical characteristics of this type of network are:

1. **Dynamic Topology**: In a mesh network, nodes can join or leave the network at any time. Therefore, the network topology is dynamic and self-organized.

2. **Multi-Hops**: Data packets can be transmitted from a source node to a destination node using several intermediaries. This is one of the main features that distinguishes a mesh network from point-to-point or star networks.

3. **Routing**: Nodes in a mesh network have the capability to perform routing. They can decide the best path to route a packet based on various criteria (e.g., number of hops, signal quality).

4. **Redundancy**: Due to its meshed topology, the network offers redundancy. If one path or node fails, the network can reroute packets via another path.

5. **Adaptability**: Mesh networks are highly adaptable to environmental or topology changes, making them ideal for situations where infrastructure might be unpredictable or constantly evolving.

6. **Security**: Mesh networks can be configured to offer enhanced security, including data encryption, node authentication, etc.

7. **Extended Range**: Using the multi-hop principle, a mesh network can cover a large geographic area, with each node acting as a relay to extend the network's reach.

8. **Density and Capacity**: Mesh networks can handle a large number of nodes, which is ideal for applications such as smart cities or large events.

9. **Underlying Technologies**: Radio mesh networks can be implemented using various radio technologies, including WiFi, Zigbee, LoRa, among others.

10. **Varied Applications**: Due to their unique characteristics, mesh networks are used in a variety of applications, from surveillance systems to sensor networks to connectivity solutions in rural areas.

In summary, radio mesh networks offer flexibility, robustness, and adaptability that make them ideal for many scenarios where traditional connectivity might be challenging.

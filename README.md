Off grif communication business card

The project is to develop an electronic board (communicator) capable of sending and receiving messages via WiFi, by Lora or Lorawan radio protocol, and by the ESP-NOW protocol. The mode of communication will vary in several ways. Option 1: Private communication between 2 boards. Option 2: Private communication between 2 boards, but using relays if they are too far apart (Lorawan network with gateways or another communicator serving as a repeater). Option 3: Broadcast communication where all users can hear and participate. A small centralized server will also need to be developed to manage traffic and handle routing. User addresses will be based on ERC-20 addresses or preferably TRC-20 to prepare for future interactions with the blockchain or to allow simple transactions (USDT on TRC-20 for instance)
